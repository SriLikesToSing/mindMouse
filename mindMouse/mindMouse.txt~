Design Doc:

Function: 
	control a computer mouse using either your head or your eyes (not decided
			what's more fluid)

	- equidistant spacing Multi-PIE landmarks
		- https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/5nucho/what_the_hell_are_the_multipie_landmarks/
		- feels incredibly scammy and stupid, but seems to generalize below
		averagely, so i'll use for now. 

	use left and right eyes as a mouse clicker and do normal button 1 and button 2 functions
	with them

	features: 
		left click: left eye blink (right eye to camera)
		right click: right eye blink (left eye to camera)
		left eye close eye move down and up (scroll up and down)
		consistent results

		eye tracking route:
			- Eyes position - > stream window cordinates -> mouse cordinates 

			- is there a general purpose method? 
				- one solution requires you to put your face in

			- gonna need blink detection

			- where you look is where the direction mouse ends up moving
				- consistency needs to be atleast somehwat decent
					- hopefully with good lighting and maybe an improved model, we
					can get consistent results


		 - maybe head route might be a good option still for more consistent
		 mouse movement

	 - tracking consistently is utter dog shit.
	 	- might be a lossy compression issue, or problems with byte to byte compression
		and translation.
			- might have to information theory this to oblivion

	- got foundational library complete, the tools are there to make the rest
	of the application. Real work begins.

	
	-startup is also really snow for an external webcam compared to an
	internal one


TODO:
	- get mouse functionalitites progrrammed
	- improve consistency**CHECK ???
	- create nice user interface and init process

	- someone at NASA proposed me some cool solutions to improve latency from
	the TCP packets being sent.

		Observation #1:
			- the bytes being send per second at a rate of 30 frames per
			second is 1920*1080*3*30 = 62 megabytes persecond.
				- this is fucking crazy.
			- this and processing inefficiencies in gathering the stream is
			contributing to latency gap.
			- I tried compressing multiple frames at once and releasing them
			in periodic time, but this makes is worse for some reason.


		- lossless compression.
