Design Doc:

Function: 
	control a computer mouse using either your head or your eyes (not decided
			what's more fluid)

	use left and right eyes as a mouse clicker and do normal button 1 and button 2 functions
	with them

	features: 
		left click: left eye blink (right eye to camera)
		right click: right eye blink (left eye to camera)
		left eye close eye move down and up (scroll up and down)
		consistent results

		eye tracking route:
			- Eyes position - > stream window cordinates -> mouse cordinates 

			- is there a general purpose method? 
				- one solution requires you to put your face in

			- gonna need blink detection

			- where you look is where the direction mouse ends up moving
				- consistency needs to be atleast somehwat decent
					- hopefully with good lighting and maybe an improved model, we
					can get consistent results


		 - maybe head route might be a good option still
